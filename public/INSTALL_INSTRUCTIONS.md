3. Scroll down in the menu until you see **"Add to Home Screen"**
4. Tap **"Add to Home Screen"**
5. Edit the name if you want, then tap **"Add"** in the top right
6. ✅ App icon appears on your home screen!

## 💻 Desktop/Laptop (Chrome)

1. Open the site in **Chrome browser**
2. Look for the **install icon** in the address bar (computer with a down arrow)
3. Click it, or go to Chrome menu (⋮) → **"Install Martin Builder OS"**
4. Click **"Install"** in the popup
5. ✅ App opens in its own window!

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "I don't see the Install option in my browser menu"

**Try these fixes:**
1. **Refresh the page** (pull down or press F5)
2. **Clear browser cache**: Settings → Privacy → Clear browsing data
3. **Wait 30 seconds** - Chrome needs time to validate the app
4. **Close and reopen** the browser tab
5. **Use Chrome browser** specifically (not Samsung Internet, Firefox, etc.)

### "The status box only shows 4 checkmarks"

This means the Service Worker hasn't activated yet:
1. Wait 10-30 seconds for validation
2. Refresh the page once
3. Try again

### "I installed it but can't find the icon"

- **Android**: Check all home screen pages and the app drawer
- **iPhone**: Check all home screen pages
- **Desktop**: Check your Applications folder or Start menu

## ✅ How to Know It Worked

Once installed correctly:
- The app **opens in its own window** (no browser address bar)
- You see the **Martin Builder OS logo** as the app icon
- The app works **offline**
- The banner at the top **disappears** (because you're in the app now)
